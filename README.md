# La Vie: A DeFi/NFT Yield Farming Game
This project was built using Reactjs, Scaffold-ETH, Hardhat and Alchemy.\
It uses decentralized services such as Skynet, IPFS (Proton Labs), Chainlink, Status, Textile.io, Superfluid.Finance,Compund and 88MPH.
\
# The Idea behind La Vie:
La Vie is a prototype to test an idea that is unheard of outside of the Blockchain industry.\
\
Can you marry gaming with banking?\
Can users interact with their banks as much as they interact with the games they play?\
\
This project allows users to put money off to the side to play La Vie.\
It's similar to purchasing a Certificate of Deposit - with a twist: if you buy into it, you get to play this game.\
All in game purchases would require the user to stake more money: to save more as opposed to spending more.\
Gamified Finance doesn't only have to be for the aggressive, non-risk averse individuals. \
\
While users earn a yield on the amount they stake, the game developers themselves will also\
earn a percentage of that yield for being the game managers. This makes for a better relationship\
between gamers and developers. It incentivizes the game developers to continuously make gaming content\
to attract new players and new purchases (to attract deposits).\
It incentivizes the player to be a "sticky" customer. As opposed to the current standard of a transactionnal\
relationship: the user purchases the game and the relationship is over.\
Games requiring a subscription are more comparable. But even in these games it alienates users that can't\
shed that subscription cost per month and thus limits the growth of the game's community.\

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
